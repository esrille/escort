This directory contains Escudo web browser.

Escudo is a new web browser currently being developed as one of the ES
operating system projects.

Escudo contains a totally new CSS/HTML rendering engine written in C++11.
Escudo can be configured with SpiderMonkey or V8 JavaScript engine along
with the C++11 Web IDL binding of the esidl Web IDL compiler. For the
graphics backend, Escudo web browser uses OpenGL for the better performance
and portability.

The core components of the Escudo web browser will be used like a window
system in today's operating systems in the ES operating system, but before
doing so, we are experimenting it as a standalone web browser on Linux.
The user interface of the Escudo web browser itself is written in HTML/CSS
and JavaScript on top of the Escudo core components.
